# Progressive web app support for react based apps

Plan:

- [ ] Read docs of PWA builder and figure core lib stuff
- [x] Create sample react app
- [ ] Make PWA out of this app in a sensible manner
- [ ] Write CLI tool ala BubbleWrap to make this app electron and android apps
- [ ] Explore react native
